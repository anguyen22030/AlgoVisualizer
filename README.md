At the top there are various options for different graph algorithms (DIJKSTRA's, DFS, BFS) that users may attempt.<br />
Here is an example of Dijkstra's algorithm being run on a graph with no barriers <br />

Here is the result of running Astar with no barriers<br />

Users also have the ability to create barriers by clicking and dragging the mouse or they can select the options at the top for custom graphs.<br />
Here is a diagram of the options<br />
Simple stair<br />

Here is the recursively built horizontal maze which always has a unique construction<br />

Another horizontal maze to show Uniqueness <br />

Finally, here is the result Dijkstra's algorithm being run on the second horizontal maze <br />
